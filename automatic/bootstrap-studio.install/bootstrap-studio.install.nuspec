<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:
* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

		<!-- == PACKAGE SPECIFIC SECTION == -->
		<!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
		<!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
		<!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->
		<id>bootstrap-studio.install</id>
		<!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
		<!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
		<!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

		<summary>A powerful desktop app for creating responsive websites using the Bootstrap framework.</summary>
		<description>A license is required to use Bootstrap Studio. [https://bootstrapstudio.io/#purchase](https://bootstrapstudio.io/#purchase)

Bootstrap Studio comes with a wide array of built-in tools and components that can be dragged and dropped into the active canvas space where they can immediately build responsive web pages and animated web elements.

Bootstrap Studio is built on top of its proprietary Bootstrap framework that promotes experimentation and seamless exporting of optimized HTML pages that are ready for online deployment. The app comes with a large library of components that can be mixed and matched for the creation of unique, eye-catching and streamlined web pages. This library includes headers, footers, galleries, slideshows, and other basic elements, all accessible and usable as drag-and-drop elements that can be infused into test web pages without even knowing how to code.

**NOTE**: This package is automatically updated. If it is out of date and there is no newer package submitted, please use the `Contact Maintainers` functionality to alert me.
