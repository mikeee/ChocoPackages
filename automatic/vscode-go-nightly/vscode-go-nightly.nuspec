<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:
* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <summary>The preview version of the VS Code Go extension</summary>
        <description># Go Nightly for VS Code

_ATTENTION_: This is the preview version of the VS Code Go extension, used for early feedback and testing.
It is published nightly and contains previews of new features and bug fixes that are still under review or test. Therefore, this extension can be broken or unstable at times. If you are looking for the stable version, please install the default VS Code Go extension instead.

NOTE: The stable Go extension (golang.go) cannot be used at the same time as the preview Go Nightly extension (golang.go-nightly). If you have installed both extensions, you must disable or uninstall one of them. For further guidance, read the documentation on how to disable an extension.

# Differences between Go and Go Nightly

- Go Nightly is released more frequently than the stable version (once per weekday).
- Go Nightly includes features and bug fixes that are not yet finalized.
- Go Nightly may use pre-release versions of tools (such as gopls) instead of released versions.

For more information about Go Nightly, read the Go Nightly documentation.

The VS Code Go extension provides rich language support for the Go programming language.

**NOTE**: This package is automatically updated. If it is out of date and there is no newer package submitted, please use the `Contact Maintainers` functionality to alert me.
