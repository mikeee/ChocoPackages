`dapr` is a command-line interface for running Dapr-related tasks.

The Dapr CLI allows you to setup Dapr on your local dev machine or on a Kubernetes cluster, provides debugging support, and launches and manages Dapr instances.

Dapr is a set of integrated APIs with built-in best practices and patterns to build distributed applications. Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don't need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications.
