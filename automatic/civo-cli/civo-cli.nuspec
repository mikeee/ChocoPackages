<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->
<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->
<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:
* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

		<!-- == PACKAGE SPECIFIC SECTION == -->
		<!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
		<!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
		<!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->
		<id>civo-cli</id>
		<!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
		<!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
		<!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

		<summary>A command-line interface for Civo.</summary>
		<description>`civo` is a command-line interface for interfacing with the Civo platform.

Civo CLI is a tool to manage your Civo.com account from the terminal. The Civo web control panel has a user-friendly interface for managing your account, but in case you want to automate or run scripts on your account, or have multiple complex services, the command-line interface outlined here will be useful. This guide will cover the set-up and usage of the Civo CLI tool with examples.

**NOTE**: This package is automatically updated. If it is out of date and there is no newer package submitted, please use the `Contact Maintainers` functionality to alert me.
